## 📌 Project Overview
In the fast-paced environment of customer service operations, data-driven decision-making is essential for maintaining a balance between employee wellbeing and operational excellence. This project serves as a comprehensive diagnostic tool designed to evaluate call centre health through the lens of employee productivity and time management.

By leveraging a multi-sheet Excel framework, I transformed raw system logs into a structured analytical model. The project moves beyond simple data entry, focusing on uncovering hidden patterns in agent behavior, identifying service bottlenecks, and providing actionable insights to optimize overall call centre throughput.

## 📂 Detailed Data Architecture
The workbook is architected into specialized analytical modules to provide a 360-degree view of operations:

* **Break Adherence Analysis:** This module focuses on time-management granularity. By comparing scheduled break slots against actual "Auxiliary" (AUX) states, the analysis identifies patterns of over-utilization or schedule slippage. It highlights how minor deviations in break timing can cascade into significant increases in customer wait times during peak intervals.
* **Agent Efficiency Matrix:** This sheet calculates core KPIs, including **Average Handling Time (AHT)**, **Wrap-up Time**, and **Occupancy Rates**. By benchmarking individual performance against departmental averages, the model identifies "high-efficiency outliers" and those who may require additional technical training.
* **Overall Performance Scorecard:** A consolidated dashboard that utilizes weighted scoring to rank agents. Unlike simple metrics, this scorecard balances speed (Efficiency) with availability (Adherence), providing a fair and holistic view of an employee’s contribution to the team.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
To ensure data integrity and scalability, I employed several advanced Excel techniques:
* **Data Normalization:** Cleaned and formatted raw CSV exports using `TRIM`, `CLEAN`, and complex `Nested IF` functions to handle missing or erroneous time-logs.
* **Advanced Logic:** Utilized `XLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` for cross-sheet data validation and `SUMIFS/COUNTIFS` for multi-criteria aggregation.
* **Dynamic Visualization:** Developed interactive Pivot Tables and Slicers, allowing stakeholders to filter performance by shift, team lead, or specific date ranges.

## 💡 Business Value & Impact
The ultimate goal of this project is **Operational Optimization**. By identifying specific times of day where efficiency dips, management can adjust staffing levels. The insights derived from the Break and Efficiency sheets allow for a transition from reactive management to proactive workforce planning, ultimately reducing agent burnout and improving the end-customer experience.
